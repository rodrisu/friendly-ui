[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blablacar/ui-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blablacar/ui-library)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blablacar/ui-library.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blablacar/ui-library)

## Installation
BlaBlaCar `ui-library` is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rodrisu/friendly-ui)

Just run this inside your project
```bash
npm i @rodrisu/friendly-ui
```

## Usage
Import the package into your `package.json`. You will also need the following peer dependencies:
```
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "@rodrisu/friendly-ui": "<CURRENT_VERSION>",
    "react": "<CURRENT_VERSION>",
    "react-dom": "<CURRENT_VERSION>",
    "styled-components": "<CURRENT_VERSION>",
    "classcat": "<CURRENT_VERSION>",
    ...
}
```
then all you need to do is:
```javascript
import { Button } from '@rodrisu/friendly-ui/build/button'
```
But again, don't forget that you need to have React to make it work.
