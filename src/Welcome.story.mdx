# Welcome to Pixar's Component Library on React

Pixar components implementation on Storybook mirrors design specification on Figma. 
Therefore you  will find main sections:

| categories | description   |
| ------------- |-------------|
| **Styles** | Design Tokens and Foundations including Icons and Illustration Libraries |
| **Basic Components** | Common components (atoms) |
| **BBC Main Components** | Business Components on a more modular way (organisms) |
| **SPA** | All SPA components that haven't been specified. |
| **Pages** | Kind a dev **playgroung** where we can preview the page before implementing on the APP. |

SPA components may be
 - **Internal** components, hooks or utils.
 - **Editorial** components (mainly components that use grid and are made for landing pages)
 - **Application components** the ones that haven't been specified by Pixar yet




## Creating a new component

When creating a new component, **make sure to follow Figma taxonomy**. 

This the base of our shared vocabulary.

At Kirk, each component is stored in the `src` folder and it has its own folder with all of its information. 

Basically, a component folder will always have:

- A component `.tsx` file
- A stylesheet associated to your component `.style.tsx`
- A unit test file `.unit.tsx`
- A story file for documentation and functional testing `.story.mdx`

You can generate a component scaffolding by running

```bash
npm run generate
```

it will ask for component name and check if this name has already been taken. 

Make sure to follow Pixar naming conventions.
